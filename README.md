# CONDA-PACKAGES for FreeCAD
Conda gives the opportunity to distribute FreeCAD in a consistent way for multiple platforms. This is the biggest advantage of conda: A package-manager which works in the same way for different platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Read more about conda...</summary>

**Note: find more indepth info about conda on their [website](https://conda.io/docs/intro.html).**

## What is conda?
conda is a cross-plattform package-manager written in python similar to pip. The main advantage over pip is a very simple way to create packages for more difficult libraries which are not written in python and often need some special dependencies to get build. So conda fits in somewhere between system-package-managers like apt and yum and pip. But conda is not only usable for python. There are also a lot of packages for other interpreters available (eg.: R)

## What is anaconda?
anaconda is a distribution of common conda-packages bundled in one installable archive. Installing anaconda is a very simple way to get many of the scintific python-packages. Anaconda is available in version 2 and 3. The version number refers to the python version of the root-environment. But there is always the option to create an environment with python2 /python3 from any of those two. So my suggestion is to always use Anaconda3!

## What is miniconda?
minoconda is similar to anaconda, but only bundles a little subset of packages. Miniconda aims to be a minimalistic installation for the conda-package-manager. With the conda-package-manager you are able to install any package which is provided by Anaconda, and many more.

## What are environments?
An environment has it's own environment-variables and an own directory structure. With environments it's possible to use different dependency-structures which is very useful for development and staying up to date with some of the latest packages while still having stable versions. Maybe the most important advantage of development in environments is the fact that you don't have to make any changes to your system and therefore can ran the latest packages on a very stable (old) system.
Such environments are not a new idea. This is also available through the python-package `virtual-env`.

## What is conda-build?
conda-build is a python-package to create packages for the conda-package-manager. conda-build provides some simple commands to package any kind of programs. Mainly this is done by a `meta.yaml` file where all dependencies and build-commands are specified. For more complex packages there are scripts (`build.sh`, `build.bat`) used to do the installation. Maintainer have to simple build and install some sources in a conda-build-environment and conda-build takes care of creating the package.

## What is conda-forge?
conda-forge is the community channel for conda-packages. It provides a really big set of packages. All major dependencies of  FreeCAD are available from the conda-forge-channel.

## How to Install FreeCAD WITH CONDA

## Install Miniconda:

### Linux
1. Download miniconda: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html (choose 64-bit)
2. Install miniconda: `bash miniconda-file.sh` (**Not as root!!!**)
3. Before the installation is complete it will ask you if you want to add the `anaconda-dir` to your `$PATH`? Answer affirmatively. (explanation of what this does to follow)
  
**Important Note:**  
If you do not want anaconda to be your default python executable open the `~/.bashrc` and edit the following line:  
```bash
export PATH="path_to_anaconda/bin:$PATH"
```
becomes:  
```bash
alias initConda='export PATH="path_to_anaconda/bin:$PATH"'
```
 This way conda isn't prepended to the beginning of your system `$PATH` permanently. It is only placed there when invoked using thie alias `initConda` on the comamnd lone. Then the python version used will be the anaconda version. When the computer restarts the $PATH will have been reset by default and the anaconda version of python removed. 
 
**TODO**: create an alias that removes anaconda from $PATH so no restart is required.

### Windows
- Download miniconda: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html (choose 64-bit)
- Install by double-clicking the downloaded file
- Follow the instruction and install for user.

## Installing FreeCAD

### Adding conda-forge to the channels
First we have to add the `conda-forge` channel:  
`conda config --add channels conda-forge`

### Create new environment
This depends on your platform.

#### Windows:
- Open the anaconda prompt/terminal
- Create an `env` by invoking: `conda create -n env-name freecad` > # with <env-name> is the name of the env, eg. fc_test
    (this will install all necessary packages needed to run FreeCAD)
- `activate <env-name>`
- start FreeCAD by entering: `FreeCAD`

#### Linux
- In the terminal, type our alias `initConda` (which we created in the previous section) to add anaconda python to our $PATH. The `conda` command should now  be available.
- Create an `env`: 
```bash
conda create -n env-name freecad 
# with <env-name> is the name of the env, eg. fc_test
# (this will install all necessary packages needed to run FreeCAD)
```
- At the end of this process a short statement is printed how to activate the new env: 
```bash
source activate <env-name>
```
- Start FreeCAD by typing: `FreeCAD`


### Use specific dependency versions
To create an environment with specific versions of packages you can add these packages with versions to the create command. This will give you the opportunity to reproduce an environment. eg.: in case some newer dependencies are broken.

```bash
conda create -n freecad freecad=0.17=py35_0 netgen=6.1=5 ...
```


## Additional Information

#### List all environments

```bash
conda env list
```

#### Remove environment

```bash
conda env remove -n <name>
```

#### Update  

```bash
conda update --all  
conda update conda
```

#### List added channels:

```bash
conda config --show-sources`
```

### Label definitions for freecad-channel
**main**: releases  
**dev**: development snapshots eg.: weekly builds of latests sources  
**testing**: testing for new dependencies, additional stuff


### Maintainer info:
How to fork and run on CI's
- Fork repo (github)
- Add specific channels in `recipe/conda_build_config.yaml`
- Create or view `BINSTAR_TOKEN` @ anaconda.org
- Encrypt or add `BINSTAR_TOKEN` @ ci (circleci, appveyor)
- Add encrypted key to `conda-forge.yaml`
- `conda smithy rerender` and commit
- Change source (eg. your FreeCAD fork)
